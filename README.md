# tf_idf_implementation-
implementing the algorithm TFIDF with a xlsx file for example.

This implementation get data frame of sentences, deprecating it into bags of words and applying the TFIDF vectorization

----
To run the project please:
* Fast implementation with a demo file
* Install environment variables
* Run main, and check the model result and variables
* Can be used as an external model to calculate TFIDF algorithm
